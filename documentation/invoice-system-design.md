# Invoice Management System Design Options

This document summarizes different architectural approaches for redesigning an invoice management system with a focus on performance, deployability, and scalability.

## Lightweight Design (Recommended for Home/Small Business)

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Single Go application with modular structure
- **OCR Service**: Separate container for document processing
- **Database**: SQLite (home) or PostgreSQL (small business)
- **Storage**: Filesystem-based document storage with database metadata

### Key Features
- Single binary compilation for efficiency
- Docker Compose deployment
- Minimal external dependencies
- Easy migration path from home to business use

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Minimal**: 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, 20GB storage
- **Recommended**: 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, 100GB storage
- Suitable for Proxmox VM deployment

### File Storage Approach
- PDFs stored in organized filesystem structure
- Metadata (dates, amounts, status) in database
- References in database point to filesystem locations

### Deployment
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: invoice-manager
    volumes:
      - app_data:/data
      - ./config:/config
    environment:
      - DB_TYPE=sqlite  # or postgres
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

  ocr-service:
    image: invoice-ocr
    volumes:
      - ocr_temp:/tmp/ocr
    environment:
      - WORKERS=2
```

## Balanced Design (Medium-sized Businesses)

### Architecture
- **Core**: Modular monolith for main business logic
- **Services**: Performance-critical components as separate services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper optimization
- **Caching**: Redis for performance enhancement

### Key Features
- Go as primary backend language
- Efficient background processing
- Smart caching strategy
- Document pipeline with multi-stage processing

### Infrastructure
- Docker containers for all components
- Simple Kubernetes setup for production
- Automated backups and monitoring

### Scaling Strategy
- Vertical scaling for main application
- Horizontal scaling for OCR service
- Connection pooling for database efficiency

## Enterprise Design

### Architecture
- Event-driven microservices
- API Gateway with authentication and routing
- Multiple specialized databases 
- Worker pools for resource-intensive operations

### Technology Stack
- Go and Rust for performance-critical services
- PostgreSQL for transactional data
- MongoDB for document metadata and templates
- Elasticsearch for advanced search
- Redis for caching and rate limiting

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Helm charts for deployment
- Distributed tracing and monitoring

### Key Features
- ML-enhanced document processing
- Real-time status updates
- Fine-grained access controls
- Integration with external systems

## Migration Recommendations

### Starting with Lightweight Design
1. Implement core Go backend with SQLite
2. Set up filesystem document storage
3. Create basic OCR processing service
4. Deploy with Docker Compose

### Growth Path
1. Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL when data volume increases
2. Add Redis for caching when performance needs improvement
3. Implement background workers for document processing
4. Consider Kubernetes for orchestration at larger scale

### When to Consider Enterprise Features
- User base grows beyond 100 concurrent users
- Document processing exceeds 10,000 invoices/day
- Search and analytics requirements become complex
- Integration with multiple external systems is needed

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Go Package Structure (Lightweight Design)
```
invoice-app/
├── cmd/
│   └── server/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── database/
│   ├── handler/
│   ├── model/
│   ├── service/
│   └── storage/
├── pkg/
│   ├── ocr/
│   └── template/
└── Dockerfile
```

### Database Schema (Core Tables)
- `invoices`: Invoice metadata and financial details
- `users`: User accounts and preferences
- `documents`: Document metadata with filesystem references
- `templates`: OCR processing templates
- `processing_jobs`: Background job queue

### Development Priorities
1. Robust document storage and retrieval
2. Efficient OCR processing pipeline
3. Responsive API for frontend interaction
4. Simple but effective authentication
5. Basic reporting and analytics

## Conclusion

The lightweight design offers the best balance for home and small business use, with clear upgrade paths as needs grow. Focus on building a solid foundation with clean separation between file storage and metadata, efficient OCR processing, and simple deployment.
